Before you start make sure you have database instance running.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

To access GraphQL API visit `/api` endpoint and for playground use `/api/graphiql`.

To create new database models please follow ecto guidelines and use `mix phx.gen.context`.
