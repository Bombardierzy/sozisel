defmodule SoziselWeb.Schema.Middlewares.ResourceAuthorization do
  @moduledoc """
  Middleware for loading a resource and checking if current user is allowed
  to access it for a specific method declared in `Sozisel.Model.Bodyguard` module.

  If user is authorized to access the resource, it will be stored in resolution and
  then it can be accessed via `fetch_resource/1`.

  Current user is expected to be found in resolution's context whereas resource id is expected
  in arguments map either directly under `:id` key or as nested `:id` key under `:input` map.

  **IMPORTANT**
   - A situation where resource has not been found is treated as an unauthorized event.

  TODO:
  For not the middleware allows just for a single check of resource authorization for a whole query resolution.
  Allow for multiple resource checking but just when necessary.
